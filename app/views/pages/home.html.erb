<h1>Welcome to Bee Registered</h1>
<p>
    Here you will find an easy way to share what you'd like, and for your family and friends (or even complete strangers) to help you get them!<br />
    I know, this sounds a little greedy, but let's face it... If people are intending to give you something, it'd be best if it is something you actually want!<br />
    From here, you can choose to either:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <% if current_user %>
                <%= link_to "Logout", logout_path %>
            <% else %>
                <%= link_to "Login", login_path%>
            <% end %>
        </li>
        <li>Create a <%= link_to "new user", signup_path %></li>
        <li>Search for a friend's registry</li>
        <li>Create a registry</li>
        <li>Edit an existing registry</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><span>Have</span> fun!</h2>
